Summary: 
	Max concurrent connections without dropping requests: 25 (Lab 2: 17)
	Max # of requests per second at max connections: 229.73 (Lab 2: 216.86)
	Average time per request at 25 connections: 106.4 ms (Lab 2: 17 connections -> 76.334)

	Comparison to Lab 2: 

		The max number of concurrent requests has improved to 25 from 17. This is a result
		of the fact that the server logic was refactored and optimized, and the change from temporary
		storage to permenant storage via sql in this lab decreased the load on the server. 

		The average time per request increased in this lab from 76.334 at 17 connections
		to 106.4 at 25 connections. This is largely assumed to be the result increased max concurrency 
		increasing the time for each request, and added requirements (such as javascript 
		pagination).

		Even though the average time per request increased, the max # of requests also increased, since 
		the max # of requests is measured at a higher max connections. 


Concurrency:
	The server can handle 17 concurrent connections without dropping requests.

	# of concurrent connections: average % of requests failed

	25: 0 
	50: 0.5%
	100: 8.4% 

Request Speed: 

	After 10 benchmark tests, the maximum # of requests/s achieved by the 
	server at 25 concurrent connections is 229.73. The results of that
	apache bench test are below.
