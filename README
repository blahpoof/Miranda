Benchmarking:

	Setup:
		Connect to server via public IP address from a separate machine. 
		Send requests using Apache Bench. 

	Method: 
		To determine the maximum # of concurrent connections, we ran the command:

			ab -n 1000 -c CONCURRENCY http://54.173.107.230/?keywords=toronto

		increasing CONCURRENCY by 1 until connections start to drop. We found that at 25 concurrent
		connections, requests were never dropped, whereas at 26 concurrent connections, a few 
		requests would be dropped per test. 
		We then ran 10 tests at each of 25, 50, and 100 concurrent connections to determine
		the average % of requests dropped. 

		The max requests per second from those 10 tests run at 25 concurrent connections was 
		determined to be the max RPS sustainable at maximum number of connections. 

		The mean times per request of each test run at 25 concurrent connections were averaged
		to determine the average time per request at maximum number of connections.
